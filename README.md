# ðŸš² BikeStores SQL Analysis

## Project Overview  
This project demonstrates my skills in **SQL database design, data manipulation, and analysis** using the **BikeStores sample dataset**.  
It covers the **full lifecycle of a database project**, including:  
- **Schema design (DDL)** â€“ Creating normalized tables, relationships, and constraints.  
- **Data management (DML)** â€“ Inserting, updating, and deleting records.  
- **Business-oriented queries** â€“ Extracting meaningful insights for decision-making.  

The project simulates a real-world retail business scenario with **sales and production schemas**, focusing on customers, products, orders, stores, and inventory.  


## Project Structure  

### DDL Scripts (Database Design)  
- **DDL_Task1.sql**   
  - Create the `SalesProductionDB` database with tables for `customers`, `staffs`, `stores`, `orders`, `order_items`, `categories`, `brands`, `products`, and `stocks`.  
  - Define **primary keys, foreign keys, and constraints** to ensure referential integrity.  

- **BikeStores Sample Database - create objects.sql**  
  - Creates the original **BikeStores schemas (sales, production)** and their objects.  

- **BikeStores Sample Database - drop all objects.sql**  
  - Cleans up the environment by dropping all schemas and tables.  


### DML Scripts (Data Management)  
- **DML_Task1.sql**  
  - Inserts sample data into key tables (`customers`, `stores`, `staffs`, `orders`, `categories`, `brands`, `products`, `stocks`, `order_items`).  
  - Updates phone numbers, product prices, order status, and staff assignments.  
  - Deletes invalid or canceled customers.  
  - Ends with **SELECT queries** to retrieve insights such as:  
    - Sales per store  
    - Best-selling products  
    - Available stock  
    - Customer order counts  

- **BikeStores Sample Database - load data.sql**  
  - Populates the `production` and `sales` schemas with realistic data:  
    - Brands (Trek, Electra, Haro, Surly, etc.)  
    - Product categories  
    - Inventory stocks  


### Analytical Queries  
- **Task2_sql.sql**  
  - A collection of business-driven SQL queries, including:  
    - Most expensive bike  
    - Total & valid customers  
    - Revenue per store  
    - Most & least sold categories/products  
    - Rejected orders analysis  
    - Customer-level insights (orders, products purchased, staff who processed them)  
    - Staff and manager workload  
    - Best-performing states by sales  
    - Stock analysis for the most liked brand  


## Key Skills Demonstrated  
- **Database Design (DDL)** â€“ Creating normalized schemas, relationships, and constraints.  
- **Data Manipulation (DML)** â€“ Inserting, updating, deleting, and querying records.  
- **Analytical SQL Queries** â€“ Using joins, aggregations, grouping, filtering, and ordering.  
- **Business Use Cases** â€“ Revenue analysis, customer insights, inventory tracking, and sales performance evaluation.  


## Key Takeaways  
- Built and managed a **complete sales & production database system**.  
- Applied SQL queries to **extract actionable business insights**.  
- Strengthened expertise in **database management, SQL querying, and problem-solving**.
